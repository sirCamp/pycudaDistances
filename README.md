# PycudaDistances

  Fast python distance computations in a variety of metrics that uses Graphics Processing Units with PyCuda.
  
  This is a framework that will allow general distance metrics to be incorporated into tree-based neighbors searches. 
  The idea is that we need a fast way to compute the distance between two points under a given metric. 

## Usage

	>>> from pycudadistances.distances import euclidean_distances
	>>> X = [[0, 1], [1, 1]]
    
    >>> euclidean_distances(X, X)
    array([[ 0.,  1.],
           [ 1.,  0.]])
    
    >>> # get distance to origin
    >>> euclidean_distances(X, [[0, 0]])
    array([[ 1.        ],
           [ 1.41421356]])
